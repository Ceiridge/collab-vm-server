                        <center>A few people asked me to put up a donate button, so here you go. Do you like Collab VM? Do you want to donate to the developers of the project? You can do so by clicking the button below. Please note that  Collab VM is a completely <b>free</b> service! You have no obligation to donate even if you use the virtual machine a lot. Just going to the website is enough support. Only donate if you really want.<br><br>Soon there will be donor features, which will include longer turns, a colored name, and other things.
